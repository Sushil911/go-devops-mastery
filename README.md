# go-devops-mastery

This is just my personal playground where I’m teaching myself Go + DevOps the hard way.

Right now (Dec 2025) I’m a complete beginner who only knows how to:
- Run `go run main.go`
- Make a tiny HTTP server that prints stuff
- Send JSON with curl

I started with Next.js/tRPC and got super confused because I never understood what was happening under the hood.  
So I decided to throw away all the magic and start from zero with Go backend + DevOps.

## What’s inside right now
Honestly, almost nothing yet:
- One folder with a very small Go server (just learning how HTTP, JSON, and goroutines work)
- A simple cpu-hog experiment with basic graceful shutdown and half-written code

## My other repo (where the real thing is growing)
→ https://github.com/Sushil911/chaosboard  
(that’s my mini Litmus Chaos project. Still super basic, but it’s the main thing I’m working on)

## Why this repo exists
So I can:
- Look back in 6 months and see the actual progress
- Show future employers or LFX reviewers that I actually learned things step by step

No fancy words, no fake progress.  
Just a guy from Nepal learning in public, one tiny commit at a time.

If you’re also grinding Go or DevOps and want to say hi, open an issue or DM me on X (@Sushil911). I’d love tips.

Still at the beginning.  
See you at the finish line someday.
